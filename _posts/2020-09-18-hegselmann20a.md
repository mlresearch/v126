abstract: "Applying machine learning in healthcare can be problematic because predictions
  might be biased, can lack robustness, and are prone to overly rely on correlations.
  Interpretable machine learning can mitigate these issues by visualizing gaps in
  problem formalization and putting the responsibility to meet additional desiderata
  of machine learning systems on human practitioners. Generalized additive models
  with interactions are transparent, with modular one- and two-dimensional risk functions
  that can be reviewed and, if necessary, removed. The key objective of this study
  is to determine whether these models can be interpreted by doctors to safely deploy
  them in a clinical setting. To this end, we simulated the review process of eight
  risk functions trained on a clinical task with twelve clinicians and collected information
  about objective and subjective factors of interpretability. The ratio of correct
  answers for dichotomous statements covering important properties of risk functions
  was 0:83\x060:02 (n = 360) and the median of the participants’ certainty to correctly
  understand them was Certain (n = 96) on a seven-level Likert scale (one = Very Uncertain
  to seven = Very Certain). These results suggest that doctors can correctly interpret
  risk functions of generalized additive models with interactions and also feel con\fdent
  to do so. However, the evaluation also identified several interpretability issues
  and it showed that interpretability of generalized additive models depends on the
  complexity of risk functions."
