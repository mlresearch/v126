abstract: "The automatic generation of captions from medical images can provide for
  an efficient way to annotate histopathology images with natural language descriptions.
  Such large-scale annotation of medical images may help facilitate image retrieval
  tasks and standardize clinical ontologies. In this work, we focus on developing
  and methodically evaluating a new caption generation framework for histopathology
  whole-slide images. We introduce PathCap, a deep learning multi-scale framework,
  to predict captions from histopathology images using multi-scale views of whole-slide
  images. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms a standard baseline caption
  model on a diverse set of human tissues and provides interpretable contextual cues
  for understanding predicted captions. Finally, we draw attention to a novel dataset
  of histopathology images with captions from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
  project, providing a valuable dataset for the machine learning and healthcare community
  to benchmark future caption prediction and interpretation methods."
